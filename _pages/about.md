Hi, welcome to my homepage.

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistical Science at University College London, supervised by Ricardo Silva and Arthur Gretton. My research focuses on kernel methods, statistical learning theory, and causal inference. More recently, I am interested in deep learning theory, particularly the implicit biases of transformers. 

Prior to my PhD, I obtained a MSc degree in Mathematics from King's College London and a second MSc degree in Machine Learning from University College London. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from University of Cambridge.
