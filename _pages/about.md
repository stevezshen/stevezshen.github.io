Hi, welcome to my homepage.

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Statistical Science of University College London, working with Ricardo Silva and Arthur Gretton. My research interests center around kernel methods, statistical learning theory and causal inference. Prior to my PhD, I obtained a MSc degree in Mathematics from King's College London and a second MSc degree in Machine Learning from University College London. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from University of Cambridge.
