Hi, welcome to my homepage.

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/) at University College London, supervised by [Ricardo Silva](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgtrbd/) and [Arthur Gretton](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/index.html). I'm learning about kernel methods, statistical learning theory, and causality. I am also interested in deep learning theory, particularly the implicit biases of transformers. 

This website is still a bit empty, but I plan to gradually build it up over the course of my PhD. Stay tuned!
