Hi, welcome to my homepage.

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistical Science at University College London, supervised by Ricardo Silva and Arthur Gretton. I'm learning about kernel methods, statistical learning theory, and causality. I am also interested in deep learning theory, particularly the implicit biases of transformers.
